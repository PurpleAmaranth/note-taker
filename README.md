# Express.js: Note Taker
# note-taker

## Description

For this project I modified starter code to create an application called note-taker that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an Express.js back end, saves, and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end was already created. I built the back end, connected the two, and then deployed the entire application to a GitHub URL.


## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```


## Instructions

```
To use the note-taking application.
Open the Note Taker and use the landing page to visit a link to a notes page.
Click on the link to the notes page to view an existing note listed in the left-hand column.
There are empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
Enter a new note title and the note’s text.
The save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
If you click on the Save icon, the new note entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
After clicking on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
that note appears in the right-hand column.
If you click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
you will see empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
```
